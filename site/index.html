	<h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
	<h3>who we are</h3>
	<p>Bike Walk Vote works to elect candidates who best support Oregon's bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit riders. We also work on ballot measures.</p>
	<p>Formed in 2004, we have worked in elections in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Our endorsed candidates and measures won 15 of 19 elections.</p>
	<p>After a hiatus in 2010, we have relaunched Bike Walk Vote. Our first action was endorsing Alissa Keny-Guyer for appointment to the Oregon legislature, an appointment she won. We are now ramping up for a busy 2012 election year.</p>
	<h3>our unique value</h3>
	<p>As a political action committee, Bike Walk Vote goes where most non-profits cannot - directly into candidate elections. We endorse candidates and work to elect our strongest allies. While advocacy, organizing, education and lobbying are all valuable activities, the most influential action is electing the right people in the first place.</p>
	<h3>The People</h3>
	<p>Bike Walk Vote is run by an eight person volunteer steering committee who represent a cross-section of skills and interests in the biking, walking, and transit community.</p>
	<ul id="steering">
		<li>
			<h4>Evan Manvel, co-chair</h4>
			<p>Evan served as Executive Director of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance from 2005 to 2007, and as the Legislative Director for the Oregon League of Conservation Voters in 2008 and 2009. He has also served as campaign manager for Robert Liberty and Paul van Orden. He is now the Principal of Manvel Public Affairs.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Peter Welte, co-chair</h4>
			<p>Peter is a pretty great guy. After the 2008 political season, bike walk vote lost a lot of momentum. Peter brought the PAC back from the dead.</p>
			<p>Outside of BWV, Peter builds websites and applications. He's no code monkey though. Peter is a digital <em>craftsman</em>.</p>
			<p>Also, the soft spoken, big hearted Mr. Welte has a sweet beard. No kidding, its awesome.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Jodi Jacobson-Swartfager, treasurer</h4>
			<p>A Spokane native, Jodi moved to Portland in 2000 and immediately fell in love with Portland's bike scene.</p>
			<p>She's currently enrolled in Portland State University's Masters of Urban and Regional Planning program.</p>
			<p>She can't wait to see the world covered with bike lanes.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Jeff Jacobson-Swartfager, graphic&nbsp;designer</h4>
			<p>Jeff is the head of Press at an education and consultant company in Vancouver, WA. He also works as a freelance graphic designer.</p>
			<p>Jeff loves his wife and his bike.</p>
			<p>His mustache tickles.</p>

	<h3>The Questionnaire</h3>
	<p>We continually work to have our questionnaires inform candidates about the most current issues in the bike, walk, and transit communities. Each race may have a different questionnaire, which helps inform our endorsement decisions. We also sometimes supplement written questionnaires with in-person interviews.</p>
	<p>Here’s our 2011 version of our state legislative questionnaire.</p>
	<ul id="questions">
		<li>
			<p><strong>General approach</strong>. The City of Portland has often been named the best bicycling city in the country. Yet while our 2030 Bike Plan sets a goal of 25% of trips by bike, only about 6% of trips are currently taken by bike. Similarly, our Climate Action Plan demands we dramatically reduce driving. Why do you think more Portlanders don’t walk, bicycle, or take transit for transportation, and what will you do to help Portland meet its goals and become an even better city to bike in, as well as a great city to walk and take transit?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Bike/Walk fair funding share</strong>. Given that one-quarter of Portlanders are too young, old, infirm or poor to drive, and roughly 9% of commutes are by walking and 6% by bicycle, how much of PBOT’s budget should go to walking, biking, and transit projects? Would you support a city policy to earmark at least that percentage of funding for those projects?<p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Pedestrian innovation</strong>. The current plan to invest $8 million per year in sidewalk maintenance, upgrades, and infill has fallen short of funds. And engineering requirements, right-of-way shortages, and other factors mean sidewalks are expensive to build (though compared to highway interchanges, they’re very cheap!) Some advocates are calling for less-than-full-build approaches to pedestrian space, getting more miles of lower-quality facilities. How can we create more safe space for pedestrians in difficult budget times?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Funding shortfalls and innovation</strong>. PBOT has a $16 million hole for 2012, and ODOT is short of funds, and falling behind on maintenance responsibilities. Meanwhile, we fail to have complete networks of safe ways to get around without a car. Many economists and transportation advocates are excited about the idea of using pricing signals to improve our transportation system, with particular interest in congestion pricing, demand-responsive parking rates, and internalizing the externalized costs and benefits of transportation modes (for example, the CDC estimates $1000 in annual health care savings from every active person).</p>
			<p>What would you do to bring in more money for our transportation needs? Do you support parking taxes, street fees, or demand-responsive parking rates?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Choices and public perception</strong>. Critics of bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects often contend cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users don’t pay their fair share in road taxes and other user fees. How would you make the case for allocating funds and limited street space for bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Traffic calming and innovative cross-department collaboration</strong>. There is significant concern about the silos between departments in the city&mdash;an issue that has been noted by candidates for years. Traffic speed is the leading factor in crashes, and one of the largest contributors to whether a crash is fatal, and visible or physical narrowing of lanes is one of the most effective ways at reducing speed. Was the funding of bioswales and the partnership of the Bureau of Environmental Services with PBOT to get traffic safety benefits while doing smart sewer investments the wrong policy or the wrong spin? What would you have done differently?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Traffic safety</strong>. Traffic-related crashes are the top cause of death and injury for Oregonians aged 1 to 34. Pedestrian injuries and deaths are a serious problem in Oregon, with one serious injury a day and one death a week, encompassing 14% of traffic deaths in Oregon and 30% of deaths in Portland. Last year, 18 pedestrians died in Portland. Is safety the highest priority of the transportation system? If so, what policy and implications does that have?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>CRC Highway Mega-project</strong>. There has been a lot of pressure to build the most expensive public works project in the region’s history, the five-mile long highway project known as the Columbia River Crossing. Despite being a multi-billion dollar project, bicycle and pedestrian facilities involved are substandard, including an under-highway mile-long path, a five-block corkscrew detour into Vancouver, and a mostly minimum-width-allowed 16-foot path width, all for a facility designed to serve the next 100 years. The project is diverting billions of dollars from other regional priorities to build an expansion that won’t solve congestion. What are your views on the mega-project and what would you do about it as an elected official?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Transportation Equity</strong>. While light rail and streetcar efforts have generally managed to find funding over the past two decades, bus investments have been cut. Streetcar investments are focused on the denser central city, higher income populations and the urban condo lifestyle. Meanwhile, transportation costs are often more than 20% of a household’s budget, and many households are too poor to drive everywhere or own enough cars to get everywhere through driving. How would you ensure low-income communities receive equitable investments in transportation? How do you think the Office of Equity will influence transportation decisions?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Economic development</strong>. Portland State University research has found increased foot traffic in stores adjacent to bike corrals (on street bike parking). And Travel Oregon has used bikes as a significant theme in their advertising for tourists, as well as in their efforts to attract the so-called creative class. In your mind, are investments in bikes, walking, and transit effective and efficient tools for economic development? If so, how forcefully and publicly will you make this case, in the face of anti-bicycle rhetoric from some segments of the business community?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Contributing to transit’s success</strong>. Transit is the backbone of our regional transportation system. The Federal Transit Administration considers a 3-mile radius around transit stops to be the catchment area for linking walking and biking to transit. While the city does not run the transit system, it does provide access to transit as well as some of the sidewalks at transit stops. Which transportation investments would you prioritize to support the transit system?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>The Portland Plan</strong> is guiding our city into building 20 minute neighborhoods in Portland, places where people can get around quickly and easily.  What are the biggest obstacles you see to realizing this vision for our neighborhood centers?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Personal Example and Understanding</strong>. How do you currently travel around town, and how do you commute to work?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Past Accomplishments</strong>. Do you have any specific accomplishments in improving the quality of life for bicycle, pedestrian and transit users in Oregon or other places?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Campaign viability</strong>. What makes you a viable candidate?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Endorsements</strong>. Who from the active transportation community supports you?</p>
		</li>
		<li>anything to add?</li>
